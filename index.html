        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Long Gown</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A gown, from the Saxon word, gunna, is a usually loose outer garment from 
        knee-to full-length worn by men and women in Europe from the Early Middle Ages to the 17th century,
        and continuing today in certain professions; later, gown was applied to any full-length woman's
        garment consisting of a bodice and attached skirt. A long, loosely fitted gown called a Banyan was
        worn by men in the 18th century as an informal coat. Gowns were worn by students attending early 
        European universities in the 12th and 13th centuries. The gowns and hoods worn would indicate their 
        status. From the 14th to the 17th centuries, the term gown was used to describe any long, loose, 
        robe-like garment worn by both men and women. In 1500s Italy, gowns were also known as camora or 
        by regional names in various locations. The look of the camora changed over time, starting out 
        with a high waist and low neckline at the beginning of the century and gradually becoming low-waisted
        and high-necked by the end </p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">TUXEDO</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A tuxedo is an ensemble (or outfit) of clothing which includes 
        a white dress shirt, a bow tie, dress pants, a tuxedo suit jacket (sometimes called a dinner jacket),
        leather dress shoes, and sometimes a vest or cummerbund, top hat and gloves. In European countries, 
        this outfit is called black tie. Many men wear this outfit in Western countries on formal occasions 
        like a marriage ceremony or a fancy party or dance. The white dress shirt is usually made of cotton 
        or linen. A dress shirt has a stiff collar and it is ironed before it is worn. A bow tie is usually 
        made of silk or polyester, and it is usually black or white. Dress pants are made of wool or polyester,
        and they are ironed before they are worn. A tuxedo suit jacket is usually made of wool or polyester. 
        Suit jackets have a collar, pockets, and a silk or polyester lining. Leather dress shoes are usually 
        made of dark-colored leather which is polished. Sometimes, a person wearing a tuxedo will also wear 
        a sleeveless vest with buttons in the front, a black top hat, and white gloves. Some men wear a 
        tuxedo for their jobs, such as symphony orchestra musicians or waiters in expensive restaurants. </p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Sherwani</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Sherwani is a long-sleeved outer coat worn by men in South Asia.
        Like the Western frock coat it is fitted, with some waist suppression; it falls to below the knees 
        and is buttoned down the front. It can be collarless, have a shirt-style collar, or a stand-up collar
        in the style of the Mandarin collar.[1] It evolved in India in the 19th-century as a result of the 
        outer garment of the late Mughal period, the angarkha, being given a western style. It can be 
        distinguished from the Indian achkan by its greater length and heavier fabric.Sherwani evolved from 
        a Persian cape (balaba or chapkan) and was developed into the sherwani, with buttons down the front, 
        following European fashion.</p>
