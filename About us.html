            <u><h3>Our speciality</h3></u>
            <p>Fashion is a form of expression. Fashion is what people wear in a specific context. If a stranger would appear in this setting,
            adorning something different, the stranger would be considered "out of fashion."Early Western[when?] travelers who visited India, 
            Persia, Turkey, or China, would frequently remark on the absence of change in fashion in those countries. In 1609, the secretary of the 
            Japanese shōgun bragged inaccurately to a Spanish visitor that Japanese clothing had not changed in over a thousand years.
            However, these conceptions of non-Western clothing undergoing little, if any, evolution are generally held to be untrue; 
            for instance, there is considerable evidence in Ming China of rapidly changing fashions in Chinese clothing.
            Similar changes in clothing can be seen in Japanese clothing between the Genroku period and the later centuries 
            of the Edo period (1603-1867), during which a time clothing trends switched from flashy and expensive displays of wealth 
            to subdued and subverted ones.Changes in clothing often took place at times of economic or social change, as occurred in ancient Rome 
            and the medieval Caliphate, followed by a long period without significant changes. In 8th-century Moorish 
            Spain, the musician Ziryab introduced to Córdoba[15][unreliable source][16] sophisticated clothing styles 
            based on seasonal and daily fashions from his native Baghdad, modified by his inspiration. Similar changes in fashion occurred in the 
            11th century in the Middle East following the arrival of the Turks, who introduced clothing styles from Central Asia and the Far East.[17]
            Additionally, there is a long history of fashion in West Africa. Cloth was used as a form of currency in trade with the Portuguese and 
            Dutch as early as the 16th century,[18] and locally-produced cloth and cheaper European imports were assembled into new styles to accommodate the growing elite class of 
            West Africans and resident gold and slave traders.[18] There was an exceptionally strong tradition of weaving in the Oyo Empire, and the areas inhabited by the Igbo people.[18]</p>
